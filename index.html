         We are a family of dog people. 
          Our Black Labs, Daisy and Lola, come
           with us everywhere they are allowed,
            but when it comes to eating and drinking,
            the list of dog-friendly places in New York City 
            is sadly very short. So, we decided to create a 
             space where New Yorkers like us could enjoy the 
             company of their pups over an expertly prepared 
             cup of coffee or a casual glass of wine. Enter Black Lab Café:
              a safe, dog-friendly environment on the Upper West Side with 
              tasty treats for humans and canines alike.</h3>
